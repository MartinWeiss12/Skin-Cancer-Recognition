## Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Classification

This repository contains the data, labels, and Jupyter Notebook that I used to recreate the Nature Publication [*Humanâ€“computer collaboration for skin cancer recognition*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0942-0).

Please reference the article I wrote on my website that goes over the code and my approach in detail: [Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Classification](https://martiniweiss.com/projects/skin-cancer-recognition).
